## Why Homey?
Homey is a platform designed for people to sell and buy homemade goods. It aims to replace social media platforms that do not provide comprehensive support to these individuals. 

<br />

## What is Homey

Homey is a all-in-one web application that will allow sellers to make and edit posts about items they sell, and manage orders using a simple and intuitive dashboard. Buyers can create their own accounts and directly purchase goods from the app. They can also provide feedback in the form of rating and reviewing goods.
